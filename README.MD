## 🏠 Introduce

Since graduating, I've been constantly thinking about how to refine my JavaScript skills and broaden my horizon of front-end knowledge. After that, I confirmed that **reading source code is the best way to get ahead quickly**, so I spent a year continuously pushing the process of reading code.

From laying out a plan, to figuring out the skills of taking notes, to overcoming difficulties in reading code of some great frameworks, I learned a lot and was able to sink my teeth into it as I continued to challenge and explore 💯. `Fancy Front End` is one such site, which is all about source code and the better progress of front-end developers.

## 🧋 Insights

Reading the source code is not an easy task, but it is definitely **the most rewarding thing to do**. 👍

## 🎯 Targets

- 🔥 Learn the source code of the front-end **progressive frameworks** and experience the **intrinsic laws and features** of them.
- 🔥 Learn the source code of excellent tools and libraries for Web and NodeJS environments to build up **links of knowledge**.
- 🔥 Learn the skills of source code reading and **improve the ability** to learn new knowledge and complex knowledge.
- 🔥 Learn **article writing skills**, translate knowledge into easy-to-understand articles, and do **more sharing**.

## 📦 Content
